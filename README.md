This is the project for the Code Louisville Front End Web Development course.

I have made a simple website to showcase my girlfriend's food and recipes.
It uses a short JS code to filter the types of food based on three options, whether it is sweet or savory, and if it is vegan or not.

Menu and About page have been started, but are not fleshed out and do not work.
